    <img src= "IMG_1728.png" style="max-width: 300px;">
    <p> The most common form of egg found in most breakfast-food places. 
      <br>
      It's hard to mess up a scrambled egg, 
    unless you set the heat on max. 
      <br>
    Pros: 
      <br>
    -Easy to make, doesn't require much skill
      <br>
    -Can turn into an omelet with some seasoning
      <br>
    -Can make crispy or fluffy
      <br>
    -Great with ketchup
      <br>
    Cons:
      <br>
    -Same texture throughout, so it lacks anything special
      <br>
    -Can only mainly be eaten with breakfast food, like sausage or bacon
      <br>
    -Takes physical effort to scramble
      <br>
