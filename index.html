    <p> There is a lot of discussion around the best way to serve an egg for breakfast. Let's take a look
    of the pros and cons of two common forms that result in many heated debates. </p>
    <h2> Scrambling Eggs</h2>
    <img src= "IMG_1728.png">
    <p> The most common form of egg found in most breakfast-food places. It's hard to mess up a scrambled egg, 
    unless you set the heat on max. 
    Pros: 
    -Easy to make, doesn't require much skill
    -Can turn into an omelet with some seasoning
    -Can make crispy or fluffy
    -Great with ketchup
    Cons:
    -Same texture throughout, so it lacks anything special
    -Can only mainly be eaten with breakfast food, like sausage or bacon
    -Takes physical effort to scramble
