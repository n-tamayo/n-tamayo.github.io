    <p> The most common form of egg found in most breakfast-food places.  
      
    It's hard to mess up a scrambled egg, 
    unless you set the heat on max.  
      
    Pros:        
      
    -Easy to make, doesn't require much skill      
      
    -Can turn into an omelet with some seasoning     
      
    -Can make crispy or fluffy   
      
    -Great with ketchup   
      
    Cons: <br>
    -Same texture throughout, so it lacks anything special <br>
    -Can only mainly be eaten with breakfast food, like sausage or bacon <br>
    -Takes physical effort to scramble
