    <h1> Eggs: Scrambled or Fried? </h1>
    <p> There is a lot of discussion around the best way to serve an egg for breakfast. Let's take a look
    of the pros and cons of two common forms that result in many heated debates. </p>
    <h2> Scrambling Eggs</h2>
    <img src= "IMG_1729.png" style="max-width: 100px;">
    <p> The most common form of egg found in most breakfast-food places.  
    It's hard to mess up a scrambled egg, 
    unless you set the heat on max. <br>
    Pros: <br>
    -Easy to make, doesn't require much skill <br>
    -Can turn into an omelet with some seasoning <br>
    -Can make crispy or fluffy <br>
    -Great with ketchup <br>
    Cons: <br>
    -Same texture throughout, so it lacks anything special <br>
    -Can only mainly be eaten with breakfast food, like sausage or bacon <br>
    -Takes physical effort to scramble <br>

    <h3>Frying Eggs</h3>
    <img src= "IMG_1728.png" style="max-width: 100px;">
    <p> This egg form is a little fancier, not often advertised in most breakfast-food places.
    There's definitely a higher chance of messing up with this egg. <br>
    Pros: <br>
    -Lots of variation: runny, soft, solid <br>
    -Different texture with the yolk and white <br>
    -No physical labor required <br>
    -Goes with a lot more food, like rice or bread <br>
    Cons <br>
    -You need to be good at telepathically knowing when the egg is cooked enough <br>
    -Can only season the outside of this egg <br>
